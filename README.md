## Overview

Notewave is a feature-rich, web-based productivity and collaboration tool, inspired by Notion. It is built with React, Next.js, Next.js Router, Tailwind CSS, Clerk, Convex, and Edge Store, using TypeScript and Shadcn for enhanced development. Although it does not currently support real-time collaboration on pages, it allows users to easily share pages with everyone.
